# cartpole v1
cartpole v1 is a game environment that provided from the openai gym you can take a look at it from [here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1)      

### Here are, I'm providing three python files file:            
- `run-without-AI`:         
  >  How the game is look like without training an AI algorithm for playing it      

- `run-using-saved-model`:      
  > that will make you run the pretrained model that exist in the folder called `savedModel`        

- `train-and-run`:      
  > That will make you retrain the model and you can go to the python file and try to tune the parameters to get a better results.
